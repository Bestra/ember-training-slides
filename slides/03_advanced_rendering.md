<!-- jsbin modal -->
# Rendering Modals

- use a named outlet, `{{outlet "modal"}}`

[A simple modal](http://emberjs.jsbin.com/yiyuji/1/edit?html,css,js,output)

- [Ember.Route.render](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Route.html#method_render)
docs are useful

^
- the controller created by render is a singleton
- Disconnecting the outlet doesn't destroy the controller
